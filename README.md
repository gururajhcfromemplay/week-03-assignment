Completed the following tasks as a part of my learning with CSV,PDF,Dates, Times,Regular Expressions,Web Scraping, Exception Handling, Data Visualization with Matplotlib

Working with CSV and PDFs

Reading, Writing CSV
Assignment: Read a CSV file named "people.csv" containing user details like Name, Age, Email and write this data to a new CSV file named "output.csv" but in reverse order of rows (i.e., last row of input becomes first row of output).
Handling headers, custom delimiters
Assignment: Given a CSV file "cars_data.txt" with a custom delimiter "|", read the file and write its contents to a new file "formatted.csv" with a comma as the delimiter. Ensure that the headers remain intact.
Reading PDFs: Extract info and text
Assignment: Extract text from a given PDF named "part_1.pdf" and save the extracted text to a text file named "extracted.txt".

Writing and Combining PDFs
Assignment: Combine two given PDFs "part_1.pdf" and "part_2.pdf" into a single PDF named "combined.pdf".

Skill Set: Dates, Times, and Regular Expressions
Working with Dates and Times
Assignment: Given a date string "2023-04-15", write a program to add 45 days to it and return the new date.
Formatting and Parsing
Assignment: Parse the date string "15th April, 2023" into a date object and then format it as "2023-04-15".
Intro to regular expressions
Assignment: Write a regular expression to validate email addresses. Test it on a list of sample emails and filter out the invalid ones. Sample emails can be found in file ‘emails.txt’
Basic patterns: metacharacters, literals, quantifiers, groups
Assignment: Given a text, extract all the dates using regular expressions. Get the text from file ‘pattern.txt’


Web Scraping and Exception Handling
Intro to scraping
Assignment: Write a basic script to scrape the title of a given webpage.
Making HTTP Requests with requests
Assignment: Use the requests library to fetch the content of a webpage and print its status code.
Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup4
Assignment: Parse the content of a webpage to extract all the hyperlinks (a tags) using BeautifulSoup4.
Effective web scraping
Assignment: Scrape product names and prices from a mock e-commerce webpage and save them as a CSV.
Basic exceptions: SyntaxError, NameError, ValueError
Assignment: Write a script that intentionally causes each of the mentioned exceptions and handle them with appropriate error messages.
Handling exception using try, except, finally
Assignment: Write a function to divide two numbers. Handle the ZeroDivisionError using try, except, and finally blocks. In the finally block, print "Operation complete."
Raise exception with raise
Assignment: Write a function that checks the length of a username. If the username is less than 5 characters or more than 15 characters, raise a custom exception.

Skill Set: Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Intro to Matplotlib
Assignment: Install Matplotlib and create a basic plot showing a linear relationship between two lists of numbers.
Basic Plots: Line Plots, scatter plots, bar plots
Assignment: Given a dataset of monthly sales data for a year, create a line plot for sales, a scatter plot for profit, and a bar plot for number of products sold.
Advanced Plots: Histograms, box plots, pie charts
Assignment: Given a dataset of student marks, create a histogram showing the distribution of marks, a box plot to show the quartiles, and a pie chart to show the percentage of students in each grade category (A, B, C, D, F).
Styling and Saving Plots
Assignment: Style the plots from the previous assignment using a theme of your choice and save each plot as a PNG image.
